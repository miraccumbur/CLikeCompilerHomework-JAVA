In parser class I create a main method. In this main method has a ProgramText object, a Scanner object, a Token object and a parser object. And there is a for loop. This loop run I smaller than in progText strings length values. progText string get ProgramText object. And in this loop I call parse method from parser class. The parser object has a there feature. These are scanner object, Token object and program text object. In parse method, I call nextToken methods from scanner object. This method return token object. There are two if block. If token is not EOFTOKEN enter first block. And if this token is not null enter second block. In there , a printf method and its write token type and token text. These value get token object.

In Scanner Class, Scanner object has a feature. This are Programtext object. In these  class has a isSpecial method. This method returns boolean value. This method get a char value. In this method I created a Boolean control. This boolean is false for now.There is a if block. If this char value is not a white space enter this block. After that, there is a for each loop . This loop go around TokenType enum. And if this char values equals this value enter this block. And in here control boolean values is be true and break. In this class has a nextToken method. This method return Token.There are chVur and chNext. These are char value. And these value get forum program text class.There is a if block. If this char value is not a white space enter this block.After that, there is a for each loop . This loop go around TokenType enum. And if this char values equals this value enter this block. In here create a SpecialToken object and return this. If not enter the second if block we controller char value is digit. If is digit add string value and we controlled nextChar isSpeacil if true enter a new if block but it is false not enter in this block. If enter these block create a NumberToken object, then string value be empty and return this token.If char value is not a digit, it is a letter. Now enter the other else if block.char value add again string value. Again if block controlled by isSpeacila method.In this if block if block and else block. If string value is while enter the if block and create keyword token and return this.But is not enter the else block create IdentiferToken and return this token.

In programtext class curios value is -1 and there his a try catch block in try block run readWjoleProgram method and this method return string this string value is progText.In curChar method if curios equal -1 curPos++; and return return in progtext string value in chart curpos. In nextChar method curpos++ and rez value equal curpos value. If rez equal protest length return EOf. After that, there is a for loop. i equal rez and if i smaller than protest length run this loop. In this loop has a if block. If progtext chart rez value is white space enter this block.In this block rez++; After that, again If rez equal protest length return EOf. And finally return progtExt chart rez value.

In token type enum files has our values.

In Token class, token object has a feature.This is program text object. And this class two method getTokenType and getText. Gettext return string value and gettokentype return token type.

IdentiferToken, keywordToken, numbertoken, specialToken class extends Token class. This object class get text and tokentype. And Token class superclass for these class.

EOFTOKEN class extend Token class. And token class superclass.
